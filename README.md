# E-commerce

  ## Description
  I created this application in hopes of merging the back-end of my e-commerce database with the server end points. This will allow a user to search for items and get their associated categories, tags, etc. One of the challenges I faced was getting my seeds file to populate from the command line and the update method for the product route.
